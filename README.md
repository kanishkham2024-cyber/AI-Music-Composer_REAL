# AI-Music-Composer_REAL
We built an AI music composition tool using FastAPI and HTML. Users input genre, mood, and tempo to generate custom music. The backend processes these inputs and returns a MIDI file. The frontend connects to the backend, allowing users to request and play generated music directly in the browser.
